## Apollo Federation Coverage

The tests are based on the Apollo Federation specification and cover the following directives:

- `@interfaceObject`
- `@key`
- `@external`
- `@provides`
- `@requires`
- `@extends`
- `@inaccessible`
- `@shareable`
- `@skip`
- `@include`
- `@composeDirective`
- `@override`

**Out of scope (limited by Enterprise license of Apollo Router):**

We are not able to test the following directives on Apollo Router due to the limitations of the Enterprise license:

- `@authenticated`
- `@policy`
- `@requiresScopes`
- `@override(label:)`

We plan to test these directives as soon as we have access to the Enterprise license.

## CLI

> TODO: we're working on a CLI to make it easier to run the tests, stay tuned!

---

## Instructions

First of all, you need to install and prepare the gateways. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
make install
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Be aware that `Node` and `npm` are required to run the whole setup.

### Testing all gateways

You can run the tests for each gateway by running the following command:

```bash
make test-all
```

### Testing a specific gateway

You can run the tests for a specific gateway by running the following command:

```bash
make test-[name of the gateway]

make test-grafbase-gateway
make test-cosmo-router
make test-hive-gateway
make test-apollo-router
```

### Running a gateway for a single test suite

In case you want to run only a limited set of tests, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
make test-suite-[name of the gateway] TEST_SUITE=[id of the test suite]
```

### Running a gateway for a specific supergraph

There's also the possibility to start a gateway for a selected supergraph, in case you want to run the queries yourself.

```bash
make run-[name of the gateway] TEST_SUITE=[id of the test suite]
```
